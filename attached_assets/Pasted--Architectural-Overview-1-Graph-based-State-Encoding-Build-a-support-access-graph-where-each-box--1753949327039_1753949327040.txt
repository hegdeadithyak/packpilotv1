üß† Architectural Overview
1. Graph‚Äëbased State Encoding
Build a support/access graph where each box or candidate placement becomes a node.

Edges express relationships: support (stacking), adjacency (neighbors), accessibility (reachable paths).

Annotate each node with heuristics: isStable, isAccessible, box ID, dimensions, critical flags (fragile, temperature zone proximity).

2. MCTS Over Graph‚ÄëEnhanced States
Use MCTS to simulate placement sequences:

Select from root based on UCB.

Expand by placing a new box into plausible candidate nodes.

Simulate by auto‚Äëplacing remaining boxes heuristically or via random rollout.

Backpropagate a combined reward (stability, safety, optimization).

At end, choose child of root with the highest visit count or average reward.

üõ†Ô∏è Integration Plan in Your Codebase
A. Graph Module
Create a lightweight graph utility:

ts
Copy
Edit
interface GraphNode {
  id: string;
  box?: Box; // existing or candidate
  position?: Pos;
  neighbors: Set<string>;
  isAccessible: boolean;
  isStable: boolean;
  zoneMatch: boolean;
}

interface StateGraph {
  nodes: Map<string, GraphNode>;
  addNode(node: GraphNode): void;
  addEdge(from: string, to: string): void;
  annotate(box: Box, position: Pos): GraphNode;
}
annotate(...) builds nodes for placed boxes and candidate positions.

After placement, rebuild or update StateGraph to reflect new layout.

B. MCTS Module
ts
Copy
Edit
interface MCTSNode {
  graph: StateGraph;
  stateBoxes: Box[];
  parent?: MCTSNode;
  action?: { box: Box; position: Pos };
  visits: number;
  totalReward: number;
  children: MCTSNode[];
}
Key functions:

select(node): MCTSNode using UCB1 = Q / N + c * sqrt(ln(parent.N) / N)

expand(node): MCTSNode by picking an untried action (box + candidate node)

simulate(node): number ‚Äì place remaining boxes randomly or via your evaluatePosition heuristic

backpropagate(node, reward): void

C. Optimize Flow via Zustand
Integrate MCTS into your optimizeLayout action:

ts
Copy
Edit
optimizeLayout: () => {
  const state = get();
  const root = buildRootMCTSNode(state.boxes, state.truckDimensions);
  const bestChild = runMCTS(root, 200 /* or dynamic based on box count */);
  const optimized = bestChild.stateBoxes;
  const scores = calculateAllScores(optimized, state.truckDimensions);
  const seq = generateOptimalLoadingSequence(optimized);
  set({
    boxes: optimized,
    stabilityScore: scores.stability,
    safetyScore: scores.safety,
    optimizationScore: scores.optimization,
    loadingSequence: seq
  });
}
üîÑ Pattern Recognition Note
Graph-based encoding is conceptually aligned with modern graph neural nets: encoding spatial relationships, support, and access.

MCTS parallels sampling in reinforcement learning, using rollout-based assessment rather than greedy heuristics.

Think of your current findBestPosition ‚Üí evaluatePosition logic as the ‚Äúrollout policy‚Äù‚Äî your lightweight simulator.

‚úÖ Key Takeaways
Graph state captures structural relationships, making your placement policy smarter and more explainable.

MCTS elevates placement from greedy heuristics to lookahead-aware sequencing‚Äî ideal for avoiding ‚Äúdeadlock‚Äù placements or unstable stacking.

Upgrade your existing optimizeLayout without rewriting other parts: graph + tree strategy can sit atop your current scoring/evaluation functions.

üìå Action Items
Step	Task
1	Abstract current placement/evaluation logic into reusable modules (simulatePlacement, evaluateBoxScore)
2	Implement graph builder: generate nodes for placed boxes and free‚Äëspace candidates
3	Create MCTS node and core loop (select ‚Üí expand ‚Üí simulate ‚Üí backpropagate)
4	Plug MCTS into your Zustand store‚Äôs optimizeLayout, replacing heuristic sort & greedy pack
5	Validate by visualizing search tree stats (visit count, reward), compare result vs heuristic baseline
6	Tune rollout depth (# of random placements), exploration parameter c, and scoring weights
