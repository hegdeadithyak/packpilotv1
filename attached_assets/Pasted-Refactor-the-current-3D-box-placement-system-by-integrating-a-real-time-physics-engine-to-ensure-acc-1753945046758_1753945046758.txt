Refactor the current 3D box placement system by integrating a real-time physics engine to ensure accurate simulation of truck loading dynamics. The current in-house physics model lacks consistency and realismâ€”replace or enhance it with a production-grade engine like:

Rapier.js (preferred for performance and WASM support), or

Ammo.js (Bullet Physics port for JavaScript)

ðŸ§  Simulation Requirements:
The physics engine must support and compute:

Gravity and stacking pressure

Acceleration, braking, and inertial forces

Turning dynamics and shifting load

Collision detection and contact forces

Vehicle stability during movement

ðŸ“¦ Box Placement Strategy:
Use the brute-force backtracking algorithm discussed yesterday to:

Exhaustively try valid placements respecting constraints (fragile zones, LIFO order, perishable areas)

Score each placement based on physics outputs: stability, accessibility, safety, space efficiency

Recursively simulate multiple placements and retain only the best (or top-K) configurations

ðŸ’¡ Engineering Constraints:
Do NOT disrupt the existing UI or user-facing components.

Keep physics computations modular and decoupled from presentation logic (e.g., run physics in a Web Worker or dedicated simulation module).

Ensure the system is extensible for future plug-ins (e.g., real-time rebalancing when boxes are removed).

ðŸ”š Output:
The system should return placement metadata, visual indicators (e.g., stability score), and physics stats (collisions, forces) without blocking or degrading UI responsiveness.

âœ… Key Takeaways:
Use Rapier.js or Ammo.js for realistic physics.

Implement the brute-force placement algorithm for optimal box arrangement under physical constraints.

Isolate simulation logic to maintain frontend performance and UX.

ðŸ”§ Action Items:
Install and configure Rapier/Ammo.js in the backend simulation layer.

Translate the brute-force box strategy into a recursive scoring system.

Modularize the simulation so UI stays smooth and responsive.

Test and validate results with physics-accurate output logging.
